**Conversational-AI-for-Email**

## Overview

This project focuses on processing email conversations and generating a
comprehensive response based on the extracted information. It utilizes
the Gmail API for accessing email data and the OpenAI API for generating
the response.

## Key Features

-   Access and Process Emails: Fetches emails from the latest thread in
    your Gmail inbox.

-   Extract Relevant Content: Extracts plain text content from emails,
    removing unnecessary elements like links and extra spaces.

-   Generate Email Summaries: Creates concise summaries for each email
    in the conversation.

-   Combine Summaries for Response: Merges all email summaries into a
    single prompt for OpenAI.

-   Generate Response with OpenAI: Leverages OpenAI\'s capabilities to
    create a comprehensive response based on the combined summaries.

**Requirements**

-   Python 3.x

-   Gmail API credentials

-   OpenAI API key

**Installation**

1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```
     cd [project_directory]
     ```
   - Run the following command to install project dependencies:
