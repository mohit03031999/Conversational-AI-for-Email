**Conversational-AI-for-Email**

This project focuses on processing email conversations and generating a
comprehensive response based on the extracted information. It utilizes
the Gmail API for accessing email data and the OpenAI API for generating
the response.

**Features**

-   Access and Process Emails: Fetches emails from the latest thread in
    your Gmail inbox.

-   Extract Relevant Content: Extracts plain text content from emails,
    removing unnecessary elements like links and extra spaces.

-   Generate Email Summaries: Creates concise summaries for each email
    in the conversation.

-   Combine Summaries for Response: Merges all email summaries into a
    single prompt for OpenAI.

-   Generate Response with OpenAI: Leverages OpenAI\'s capabilities to
    create a comprehensive response based on the combined summaries.
